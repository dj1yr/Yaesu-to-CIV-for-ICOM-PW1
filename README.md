# Yaesu-to-CIV-for-ICOM-PW1

this code is alpha!, i´m using a FTDX101MP with ICOM IC-PW1.
the adress of transceiver is 0x30 and from PW1 is default 0x54.

first, learnig the adress of transceiver, setting the PA in learning mode (see manual), change the band from Yaesu TRX, the interface will send CIV data when band is changed.

For testing i´m use a Arduino 2560, later make a small board with atmega8 in TQFP32 case.
